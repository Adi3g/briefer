You can enable private documents so that users can create their own private documents that are only visible to them.

This is helpful if you want to enable users to create their own "scratchpad" documents without polluting the workspace with temporary documents.

For more information about what happens when you toggle the "Private Documents" setting to "on" or "off", please read [its section on the settings page](/settings/workspace-settings#private-documents).

<Note>
  This setting is only available on the professional and enterprise versions of Briefer.

## How to enable private documents

Enable private documents by going to the workspace settings and toggling the "Private Documents" setting.

Once you toggle that setting to "on", a section called "Private" will appear underneath the "Pages" section in the sidebar. There, users can create and manage their own private documents.

If you turn this setting to "off", the "Private" section will disappear from the sidebar, and users will no longer be able to create private documents. Still, the old documents will still exist, but they won't be accessible.

## Moving private documents into your workspace

You can move private documents into your workspace so that others can see them. For that, you can simply drag and drop the private document to the workspace pages section.

When you do that, your document will cease to be private and the usual workspace permissions will apply to it

## Copying public documents into your private space

When you try to drag a workspace document into your private space, Briefer will create a private copy instead of moving the existing document.

<Tip>
You cannot move workspace documents themselves into your private space. If you wish to move a workspace document to your private space we recommend you to drag and drop it to create a private copy and then delete the original workspace document.
